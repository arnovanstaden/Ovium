                    <p>Henry grew up on a farm and spent his school holidays either working sheep or dairy. He
                        matriculated in 2003 and after a few months of working on the family farm, entered the North
                        Florida Holsteins (Florida, USA) student dairy farmer programme. After concluding that programme
                        he returned to South Africa and worked for two years as a dairy farm manager before heading back
                        to North Florida Holsteins where he worked as the cropping manager for three years. Henry
                        returned to South Africa permanently in 2011 and began his own operation raising dairy heifers
                        on leased land. Sheep were added to the operation shortly thereafter and he has not looked back
                        since. Ramah farming was established in Aug 2016 when Henry and Angus decided to enter into a
                        partnership. As an executive director of Ramah Farming, Henry is responsible for the extensive
                        farms in the Adelaide and Bedford districts as well as the Soutvlei farm irrigation ground on
                        the Great Fish River.

                    <p>Angus has 22 years of farming experience most of which have been as a sole proprietor and as an
                        executive director. Angus holds a diploma in sales and marketing from Cape Tech and has
                        completed numerous farming-related courses to ensure his ongoing professional development.
                        Following his apprenticeships with local farmers, Angus travelled and worked in both the UK and
                        Australia exposing him to different farming practices and ideas. On his return to South Africa,
                        he took over the reins of the family enterprise of farming with fine wool Merinos, Angora goats,
                        and Brangus cattle. Angus expanded the business to include aquaculture, exporting Koi fish, and
                        stock trading including a feedlot for fattening animals prior to sale. After selling his home
                        farm to the government as part of the land redistribution process, Angus developed training and
                        development courses which were to have been run for aspiring farmers on the farm. As an
                        executive director of Ramah Farming (Pty) Ltd, Angus is responsible for Management of the
                        Irrigation lands of Ramah farm & Waterloo, which includes the lambing/kidding, rearing, wool
                        classing and shearing operations and overseeing the planting and general pasture management.
